    Eat the provided specialty sloth food.

    Sloths love to eat while they move very slowly through their rainforest
    habitats. They are especially happy to consume leaves and twigs, which they
    digest over long periods of time, mostly while they sleep.

    When they eat food, a sloth's energy increases by the food's energy.

    - Parameters:
      - food: The food for the sloth to eat
      - quantity: The quantity of the food for the sloth to eat

    - Returns: The sloth's energy level after eating

    - Throws: `Error.gay` if the sloth is too gay to eat food
